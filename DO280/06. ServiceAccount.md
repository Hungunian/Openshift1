### Create a Service Account called ex280-sa in a alpha project.

```
oc create serviceaccount --help | less
```
```
oc create serviceaccount ex280-sa -n alpha
```

### Security Context Constraints (SCCs)

oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z ex280-sa
```


# Question : Create Service Account and assign root  privileged

# Deploy application in the project `alpha`:
- There is one pod already running
- Modify the application as is should run with any user as provided by application
- Application should produce output


### Solution
### Go to the project first.
```
oc project alpha
```

### Check the application.
```
oc get all
```

### Check the Pod status.
```
oc logs POD_NAME
oc get events
```
### Due to the permission issue, our application is not running. It means you need to set the serviceaccount so that container can run with any user.
```
oc set serviceaccount --help | less
```

### Please bear in mind that, you need to check if deployment or dc is runing.
```
oc set serviceaccount deployment/deployment_name ex280-sa
```
```
oc get pods
```
```
oc get route
```
