### Question 2. 
- Cluster administrator for harry 
- `leader` user should be able create project but not administrator tasks or no other user should able to create project.
- `developer` and qa-engineer should not able to modify the cluster. 
- `kubaadmin` is  not present  (make sure your cluster-admin user is working fine before delete kubeadmin, otherwise ocp-cluster not recoverable)
---
### Cluster administrator for harry
```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin harry
```

### or no other user should able to create project.
```
oc describe clusterrolebindings self-provisioner 
```
```
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group  self-provisioner system:authenticated:oauth
```

### `leader` user should be able create project but not administrator tasks
```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user self-provisioner leader
```
### `developer` and qa-engineer should not able to modify the cluster.
```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user view developer
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user view qa-engineer
```
### `Kubaadmin` is  not present  (make sure your cluster-admin user is working fine before delete kubeadmin, otherwise ocp-cluster not recoverable)

##### As of now, we haven't tried to login into the cluster, so these user are not created at cluster level. 
```
oc get users 
```

```
oc login -u harry -p review
```

```
oc login -u leader -p review
```

```
oc login -u developer -p review
```

```
oc login -u qa-engineer -p review
```

```
oc new-project  test
```

### Now, its time to remove the kubeadmin but before that login with harry user. 

```
oc login -u harry -p review
```

```
oc get users 
```

```
oc  -n kube-system  get secret/kubeadmin
```

```
oc  -n kube-system  delete secret/kubeadmin
```
