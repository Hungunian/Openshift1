# Question 1. An application is running on the `red` project. There is one pod running and your task is it must generate the output.

```
oc project red
```
```
oc get all
```

```
oc get nodes
```

```
oc describe node node_name | grep -i taint
```

### Check the `nodeSelector` in the Deployment
```
oc get deployment/deployment_name -o yaml 
```

### Check the node lables.
```
oc get nodes --show-lables
```

### We can overwrite the labels 

```
oc label nodes master3 app=prod --overwrite 
```

### Now, the pod should be running. But website is still not working. 
### Its time to check the service.

```
oc describe service/todo-svc
```

### One can notice that endpoints are missing. You need to update the label at service. Thus, check the Deployment's yaml file and look for `template.metadata.label`

```
oc get deployment/deployment_name -o yaml 
```

### Deployment is working so we will not going to change the label of Deployment and service is not working, so we will modify the service label.
```
oc edit service/todo-svc
```

#### Post check : Check the endpoints
```
oc describe service/todo-svc
```

### At the end check the URL 






# Qustion 2. An application is running on the `blue` project. There is one pod running and your task is it must generate the output.

### Solution:

```
oc project blue
```
```
oc get all
```

```
oc get nodes
```

### Check the `nodeSelector` in the Deployment
```
oc get deployment/deployment_name -o yaml 
```

```
kubectl taint nodes workernode1 color=blue:NoSchedule
```
```
oc describe  node worker1 | grep -i taint
```
### delete taint  lines in node file
``` 
oc edit node worker1    
```
### delete same taint  line
```
oc edit node worker2
```
### Make sure  pod should be in running  state
```
oc get  po
```
