## Prepare the lab. 
```
oc new-project quart
oc new-app --name todo-http --image registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/todo-angular:v1.1
oc expose service todo-http --hostname  anishrana2001.apps.example.com
```


# Protect External Traffic with TLS
### Create secure Route  with below information
- Create a secure route in `quart` project.
- Expose application https://anishrana2001.apps.example.com
- Generate self sign certificate using given  subject	
- "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Raleigh/O=Red Hat/\ CN=https://anishrana2001.apps.example.com"
- Note: Service already  created  in any given project you just have to expose  service  with https
- The application should produce the output
---
### Solution:
### Go to the give project `quart`
```
oc project quart
```

```
oc get all
```

### Check the website.
```
curl anishrana2001.apps.example.com
```


### 1. Generate a Private Key:
```
openssl genrsa -out /tmp/myserver.key 2048
```
- openssl genrsa: This command generates an RSA private key.
- -out server.key: Specifies the output file name for the key.
- 2048: Sets the key size to 2048 bits (a common and secure size)

### 2. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR): 
```
openssl req -newkey -nodes -keyout /tmp/mailserver.key  -subj "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Raleigh/O=Red Hat/\ CN=https://anishrana2001.apps.example.com"  -out myserver.csr
```
                                                                       
- openssl req: This command creates a CSR.
- -new: Indicates that you're creating a new CSR.
- -key server.key: Specifies the private key file to use.
- -out server.csr: Specifies the output file name for the CSR.
- S ubject is given in the question.    ==> "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Raleigh/O=Red Hat/\ CN=https://anishrana2001.apps.example.com"
- C: Country Name                       ==> US
- ST: State or Province Name            ==> North Carolina
- L: Locality Name (City)               ==> Raleigh
- O: Organization Name                  ==> Red Hat
- CN: Common Name (FQDN of your server) ==> https://something.example.com 	

### 3. Generate the Self-Signed Certificate:

```
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -in myserver.csr -signkey myserver.key -out /tmp/myserver.crt

OR
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key /tmp/myserver.key -subj "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Raleigh/O=Red Hat/\ CN=https://anishrana2001.apps.example.com" -out /tmp/myserver.crt
```

- openssl x509: This command generates the certificate.
- -req: Indicates that you're using a CSR.
- -days 365: Specifies the validity period of the certificate in days (365 in this example). 
- -in server.csr: Specifies the CSR file.
- -signkey server.key: Specifies the private key file to sign the certificate.
- -out server.crt: Specifies the output file name for the self-signed certificate. 



### Now, we have to delete the existing route and create a same route with CRT and KEY.
```
oc delete route/myapp-route
```
```
oc create route edge myapp-route --service=myapp-service  --hostname=anishrana2001.apps.example.com  --key=/tmp/myserver.key --cert=/tmp/myserver.crt
```
