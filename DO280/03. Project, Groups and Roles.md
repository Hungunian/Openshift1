## Solution
### Login with `harry` user. Please bear in my mind that now, admin user is `harry`.
```
oc login -u harry -p review
```

### The `harry` user will create 3 groups, `leaders`, `developers` and `qa`. 
```
oc adm group new leaders
```
```
oc adm group new developers
```
```
oc adm group new qa
```

## Post checks.
```
oc get groups
```
### Assign the `qa-engineer` user to the `qa` group.
### `oc adm groups add-users group_name username`
```
oc adm groups add-users qa  qa-engineer
```

### Assign the `leader` user to the `leaders` group. 

```
oc adm groups add-users leaders  leader
```
### Assign the `developer` user to the `developers` group. 

```
oc adm groups add-users developers  developer
```

### leader group members are able to `edit` the group `back-end` and `app-db`
```
oc adm policy add-role-to-group edit leaders -n back-end
```
```
oc adm policy add-role-to-group edit leaders -n app-db
```
### `qa` group members are able to view front-end group. 
```
oc adm policy add-role-to-group view qa -n front-end
```
