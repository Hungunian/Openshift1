- Clone the root disk of the VM named `web1` in the project `kiwi` as `web1-clone` by using Data Volumes.
- Create a snapshot of this VM and named 'web1-copy`.

### VirtualMachine to survive a node failure so that the following conditions are true:
- VirtualMachine is automatically schedule on either `worker01.example.com` or `worker02.example.com`
- In the event of a failure of either node, the VirtualMachine is automatically started on the other node

## Solution.

```
oc login -u admin -p redhatocp  https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
```
### Open a web browser and go to the web console URL.
```
https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com
```
## Click `htpasswd_provider` and log in as the `admin` user with `redhatocp` as the password.
