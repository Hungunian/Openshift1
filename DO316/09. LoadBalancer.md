# Create a service using VirtualMachine load balancing
### In the Project `kiwi` create the following Objects:

- Using the temaple `tmprhl9small` which you created previously, instantiate two identical VirtualMachine named `web1` and `web2`
- Create a service name `ex316-kiwi-svc`
    Type: NodePort
    Pod Selector: app-flix
- TCP Port 23 of each VM is connected to any worker node port 30023
- Create a route named flix-route so that above service is made available at address flix.kiwi.example.com
- Running the following command line on workerbench.example.com telnet flix.kiwi.example.com
- Effectively results in an ASCII animated sequence being played on the terminal by either VM. If you are not familiar with telnet you can use netcat instead
