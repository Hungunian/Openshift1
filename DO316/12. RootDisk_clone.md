# Prepare a VirtualMachine for cloning
- Clone the root disk of the VM named `web1` in the project `kiwi` as `web1-copy` by using Data Volumes
---

### Solution. 
### Go to the project `kiwi` first.
```
oc project kiwi
```
### Check the VM and VMi
```
oc get vm,vmi
```
### As  per the question, we have to clone the datavolume of `web1` VM. When you execute the below command, please check the "partition".

```
virtctl guestfs web1
```
```
#####  virtctl guestfs web1
#####  Use image: registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/libguestfs-tools-rhel9@sha256:92261bf1f5085f5e9ac8531af7a780c3fc40cdf1e30539968e90f1fe8bc68f2d
